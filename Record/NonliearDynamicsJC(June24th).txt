11:03:24 From Apoorva Bhandari to Atsushi Kikumoto(Direct Message):
	wait till 11.05?
11:03:29 From Apoorva Bhandari to Atsushi Kikumoto(Direct Message):
	or longer?
11:06:08 From Apoorva Bhandari to Atsushi Kikumoto(Direct Message):
	lets start. people will come when they can.
11:53:11 From Harrison Ritz (he/him) to Everyone:
	good 3b1b on taylor series expansion https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6DsjIBzJ4
11:56:01 From Rex to Everyone:
	tbh, pretty much 90% of physics is taking taylor series to the 1st order ;)
12:06:53 From Haley Keglovits (she/her) to Everyone:
	just a shoutout to a summary notes on math for ml a friend wrote which I frequently reference for definitions like jacobian/hessian -- some is very basic but his coverage is good https://gwthomas.github.io/docs/math4ml.pdf
12:07:22 From Lakshmi Narasimhan Govindarajan to Everyone:
	nice!!!!
12:13:23 From Lakshmi Narasimhan Govindarajan to Everyone:
	also if you know something about convexity, you can tell something about the global-ness or uniqueness of these extrema
12:13:32 From Lakshmi Narasimhan Govindarajan to Everyone:
	(convexity given by hessian)
12:13:43 From Lakshmi Narasimhan Govindarajan to Everyone:
	taggin on Haley's point
12:17:49 From Lakshmi Narasimhan Govindarajan to Everyone:
	saddle points also have the notion of stability. so you could be in an unstable saddle too
12:18:17 From Haley Keglovits (she/her) to Everyone:
	oh interesting thats helpful
12:20:27 From Rex to Everyone:
	i think in practice, you will rarely hit saddle points (bc that requires quite a bit of fine-tuning to happen); what normally happens is that you are drawn to them before being pushed away
12:20:44 From Haley Keglovits (she/her) to Everyone:
	does the stability of the saddle point change how likely you are to hit it?
12:22:53 From Rex to Everyone:
	not really. the thing is, to hit the saddle point, you'd have to lie exclusively on the attractive directions of motion w zero displacement along the repulsive directions -- that requires precise fine-tuning, which rarely happens in practice. that's why it's really difficult to hit them.
12:24:28 From Haley Keglovits (she/her) to Everyone:
	ah I see, thanks
12:24:36 From Rex to Everyone:
	e.g. if you have a 10D saddle point, but only 1 direction was repulsive, you need to guarantee that your phase vector lies completely orthogonal to that 1D direction. any slight error will lead ultimately to repulsion.
12:25:39 From Rex to Everyone:
	but it's this attractive-repulsive dynamics that makes them quite important
12:26:08 From Haley Keglovits (she/her) to Everyone:
	general question what is the general internal dimensionality of modern psych-task-solving networks?
12:26:38 From Haley Keglovits (she/her) to Everyone:
	I was thinking of a case with larger step sizes and a cost function which focuses on one dimension at a time, but that I guess is so very unlikely in these systems as to not be interesting
12:27:02 From Apoorva Bhandari to Everyone:
	the linear dimension is usually as high as allowed by the task. the intrinsic dimension depends on the solution - could be a lot lower.
12:27:02 From Haley Keglovits (she/her) to Everyone:
	** dim in that is it a 10, 100, 1000, plus ðŸ™‚
12:27:31 From Apoorva Bhandari to Everyone:
	as an example, the Mante et al. paper has 100 units.
12:37:10 From matthew nassar to Everyone:
	exX1=-2:.1:2
	exX2=-2:.1:2
	
	
	
	for i = 1:length(exX1)
	    for j = 1:length(exX2)
	        x_1= exX2(j).* 1-exX1(i)^2;
	        x_2= (exX1(i))./2 - exX2(j)
	        q_x(i,j)= .5.*norm([x_1; x_2])^2;
	    end
	end
	
	hold on
	imagesc(exX1, exX2, q_x)
	
	[I,J]=find(q_x==0)
	
	plot(exX1(I), exX2(J), 'or', 'lineWidth', 4)
12:37:53 From Lakshmi Narasimhan Govindarajan to Everyone:
	VScode has a "live" edit feature
12:38:01 From Lakshmi Narasimhan Govindarajan to Everyone:
	where a bunch of us can work on it at the same time
12:38:05 From Lakshmi Narasimhan Govindarajan to Everyone:
	might be cool to try
12:38:41 From Haley Keglovits (she/her) to Everyone:
	atom has one too through github but I think would have to be python
